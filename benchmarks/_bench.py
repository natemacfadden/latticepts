# Description:  Shared timing helper for the benchmark scripts: warmup +
#               repeated trials, returning the median and min/max so the
#               plots can show error bars, not a single representative run.

def timed_median(fn, *args, warmup=WARMUP, repeats=REPEATS, max_total=2.0,
                 **kwargs):
    """
    Time ``fn(*args, **kwargs)`` over repeated trials and return statistics.

    Runs ``warmup`` untimed calls (to absorb cold-start and cache effects),
    then up to ``repeats`` timed calls, stopping early once the cumulative
    timed cost exceeds ``max_total`` seconds so expensive points are not
    re-run many times.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn : callable
        The function to time. Called with ``*args, **kwargs`` each trial.
    warmup : int
        Number of untimed warmup calls before timing.
    repeats : int
        Maximum number of timed calls.
    max_total : float
        Stop after this many cumulative seconds of timed calls (always does
        at least one).

    Returns
    -------
    median : float
        Median wall-clock time in seconds across the timed calls.
    lo, hi : float
        Fastest and slowest timed call, for (asymmetric) error bars.
